### About the Experiment 

The crankshaft is a part of an engine which translates reciprocating linear piston motion into rotation. It convert the reciprocating motion into rotation by crankpins, additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the big ends of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. It is also known as crank. Crankshaft is generally connected to a flywheel to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the four-stroke cycle and also act as a torsional or vibrational damper at the opposite end.
