### Procedure for the Experiment is as follows:

1. Study the crankshaft diagram and identify its main parts such as crank pins, main journals, crank webs, and counterweights.

2. Select a suitable steel billet of required size and composition for crankshaft manufacturing.

3. Heat the billet uniformly in a furnace to the required forging temperature (hot forging range).

4. Place the heated billet in the lower forging die of the crankshaft die set.

5. Align the upper die properly with the lower die to ensure correct crank geometry.

6. Apply compressive force using a forging press or hammer to deform the billet and initiate metal flow.

7. Carry out successive forging operations using appropriately shaped dies to form crank pins, journals, and webs gradually.

8. Ensure uniform metal flow and proper grain orientation along the crankshaft profile during forging.

9. Remove excess material (flash) formed during forging.

10. Allow the forged crankshaft to cool under controlled conditions.

11. Perform heat treatment (induction hardening or nitriding) on journals and fillets to improve surface hardness and fatigue strength.

12. Carry out machining operations such as turning, milling, drilling, and grinding to achieve final dimensions and surface finish.

13. Inspect the crankshaft for dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and alignment.

14. The finished crankshaft is then prepared for assembly or further testing.
