**Crankshaft Forming :** A crankshaft is a vital engine component that converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion. Due to cyclic loading, high torque, and fatigue stresses, crankshafts require high strength, toughness, and dimensional accuracy. Hence, suitable forming and manufacturing processes are essential.

**1. FORGING OF CRANKSHAFT**
Forging is the most commonly used method for manufacturing crankshafts, especially for automotive and high-performance engines.
-> The crankshaft is forged from steel billets using hot forging.
-> Metal is plastically deformed under high compressive forces, ensuring directional grain flow along the crank webs and journals.
-> This improves fatigue strength, impact resistance, and durability.
-> Forged crankshafts are compact, dense, and free from internal defects.

**Advantage:** High mechanical strength and long service life.

**2. CASTING OF CRANKSHAFT**
Casting is used for low-speed or light-duty engines.
-> Molten metal (usually cast iron) is poured into a mould shaped like the crankshaft.
-> After solidification, the casting is machined to required dimensions.
-> Casting allows complex shapes but produces random grain structure.

**Limitation:** Lower strength and fatigue resistance compared to forging.

**3. MACHINING OF CRANKSHAFT**
Machining is a secondary process applied after forging or casting.
-> Operations include turning, milling, drilling, and grinding.
-> Critical surfaces such as main journals and crank pins are ground to high precision.
-> Machining ensures dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and alignment.

**Note:** Excessive machining is avoided to preserve material strength.

**4. HARDENING AND HEAT TREATMENT**
To improve wear resistance and fatigue life, crankshafts undergo heat treatment.
**Common methods:**
1. Induction hardening
2. Nitriding
-> Journals and fillets are selectively hardened.
-> Core remains tough while the surface becomes hard.

**Result:** Improved resistance to wear, bending, and cyclic stresses.

**5. CRANKSHAFT DIES AND THEIR ARRANGEMENT**
-> Forging is carried out using matched dies (upper and lower dies).
-> Dies are designed to gradually form:
1.Crank pins
2.Main journals
3.Webs

-> Proper die arrangement ensures:
1.Uniform metal flow
2.Minimum defects
3.Accurate crank geometry

Die forging improves repeatability and mass production efficiency.

**6. COMPARISON OF MANUFACTURING METHODS**
Crankshaft dies and their arrangement play a crucial role in the forging process, as properly designed upper and lower dies ensure uniform metal flow, accurate formation of crank pins and journals, correct alignment of crank webs, and improved dimensional accuracy of the forged crankshaft while minimizing defects.
